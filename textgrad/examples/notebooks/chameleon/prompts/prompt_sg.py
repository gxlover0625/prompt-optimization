Question: Which property do these two objects have in common?

Context: Select the better answer. Image: A pair of scissors next to a pair of scissors.

Options: (A) hard (B) bendable

Solution: An object has different properties. A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells.\nDifferent objects can have the same properties. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Look at each object.\nFor each object, decide if it has that property.\nA bendable object can be bent without breaking. Both objects are bendable.\nA hard object keeps its shape when you squeeze it. The rubber gloves are not hard.\nThe property that both objects have in common is bendable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.

Question: Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Context: Select the better answer.

Options: (A) turtle shell is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing (B) Celestine is a pure substance. It is a solid. (C) Hematite is not made by living things. It is a solid.

Solution: Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\nA turtle shell is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.\nA turtle shell is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.\nSo, a turtle shell is not a mineral.\nCelestine is a mineral.\nHematite is a mineral.\nTherefore, the answer is A.

- This question is about comparing the properties of two objects: rubber gloves and rain boots.
- The objects are related to the topic of physics and the skill of comparing properties of objects.
- Properties of objects can include physical characteristics such as color, texture, shape, size, weight, and material. In this case, the two objects have the property of being bendable in common.

Bing search response: The most common materials used for disposable gloves are Latex, Vinyl and Nitrile. Each material has its benefits and drawbacks. Latex Gloves are constructed from Natural Rubber Latex and are the most popular type of disposable glove.

Bing search response: A nonmineral is a substance found in a natural environment that does not satisfy the definition of a mineral and is not even a mineraloid. Many nonminerals are mined and have industrial or other uses similar to minerals, such as jewelry.

Retrieved knowledge:
- Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids that have a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure.
- Minerals are formed by geological processes and can be found in rocks, soils, and bodies of water.
- Turtle shells, celestine, and hematite are all solid substances, but turtle shells are not minerals because they are made by living things.

Solution: Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.\nA turtle shell is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.\nA turtle shell is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.\nSo, a turtle shell is not a mineral.\nCelestine is a mineral.\nHematite is a mineral.\nTherefore, the answer is A.
