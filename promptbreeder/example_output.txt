decimal point in the multiplier to the right by the same number of places as there are decimal places in the multiplicand. For
example, 5 x $1.50 can be rewritten as 5 x $1.50 = 5 x 150/100 = $7.50.\n\nWhen adding or subtracting decimals, you need to line
up the decimal points. For example, $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.0',
